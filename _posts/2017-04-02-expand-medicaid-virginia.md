<!-- TITLE -->
# Close the Medicaid gap in Virginia by electing a Democratic governor

<!-- Instructions -->
Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) has hit his two-term limit, and the Virginia governor's seat is wide open. McAuliffe has been a loud supporter of the ACA Medicare expansion, and has fought a Republican state Senate and House of Delegates to support the ACA. If a Republican governor stepped in, the fight for Virginia's healthcare would be dealt a huge blow.

#### Support Ralph Northam (D)

Ralph Northam, Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, is a strong advocate for medicare expansion, saying **"It is time to put politics aside and do what is right — from both a moral and business perspective — and expand Medicaid for up to 400,000 hardworking Virginians."**

#### Support Tom Perriello (D)

Tom Perriello, former U.S. Representative (VA-5), is actively campaigning for Medicaid expansion while simultaneously campaigning for Virginia's governor's seat! He is organizing a phone bank in Virginia to petition their state Congress, and would be a huge asset in the fight for healthcare.

<!-- Justification -->
##### Why does supporting these seats make sense?

{: class="post-justification"}
*Winning the governor's seat in Virginia means that the state will continue to be a divided house. Democrats control the executive branch, Republicans control the legislative branch. The Governor can thus veto Republican legislation that may hurt Obamacare, and continue to appeal the Virginia Congress to expand Medicaid.*

{: class="post-justification"}
*Ralph Northam's [guest post](http://pilotonline.com/opinion/columnist/guest/ralph-northam-do-the-right-thing-expand-medicaid/article_43f3ffbf-5211-546a-b026-808d7467e606.html) in* The Virginian Pilot *outline his dedication to expanding Medicaid. Tom Perriello is no less dedicated. In fact, his team is organizing a [Medicaid Day of Action](http://go.tomforvirginia.com/page/s/170403-medicaid-day-of-action) to phone bank in support of Medicaid expansion.*
