<!-- TITLE -->
# Find A Town Hall Where You Can Speak To Your Rep About The ACA

<!-- Instructions -->

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Look through the [Town Hall Project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yq1NT9DZ2z3B8ixhid894e77u9rN5XIgOwWtTW72IYA/edit#gid=1473996386){:target="_blank"} guide to see if there is a meeting with your Representative coming up

#### Step 2: Put it in your calendar!

#### Step 3: Come with talking points

It can be hard to figure out what exactly to say to your member of congress about the ACA. Here are some ideas:

- Do you have a personal story to share? If so, share it. Personal stories demonstrate why repealing important tenets of the ACA will be detrimental to Americans.
- Tom Price, the new Health and Human Services secretary has introduced bills that would create insurance pools of high risk individuals. This means that people with preexisting conditions could face both higher premiums and deductibles.
- An ACA replacement would not require insurance companies to provide the comprehensive coverage that it does under the current law, reducing women's health care benefits and requiring more out-of-pocket payments. 
- The Republicans' proposal will likely reduce the subsidies currently in place for lower-income Americans. This would reduce poor Americans' access to health insurance and could lead to higher premiums for everyone. 

**Note:**  If you want to plan your involvement with others, find your local [Indivisible group](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/local-action-groups){:target="_blank"}. They may have a Facebook event and a game plan going for the next town hall near you.

<!-- Justification -->
##### Why does attending a town hall make sense?

{: class="post-justification"}
*Nobody likes to be unpopular, especially in front of a large group of people. Asking your representative to address your policy concerns in person is even more effective than calling your office. And if it makes the news, it brings public attention to your cause. The pressure, thus far, seems to be putting [lawmakers in a bind](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/13/politics/republican-lawmakers-town-hall-events/){:target="_blank"}.*
