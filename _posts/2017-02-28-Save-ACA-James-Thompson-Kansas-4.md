<!-- TITLE -->
# Save the ACA by Supporting James Thompson for Kansas's 4th

<!-- Instructions -->
Each week this page will feature different candidates who could make a difference in protecting the Affordable Care Act.
Contribute to candidates in these races to win a seat for ACA supporters. 

#### Kansas' 4th District
Mike Pompeo's seat has been vacant since he was confirmed to head the C.I.A. in January.

<!-- Justification -->
##### Why does supporting these seats make sense?

{: class="post-justification"}
*There are currently 3 seats open in the House of Representatives that will be filled soon through special elections. Getting ACA allies elected will bring us closer to winning a majority of seats in the House and Senate. Having a majority will be essential to passing (or voting down) future healthcare legislation.*
