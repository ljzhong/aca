# Meet your rep in a town hall and ask them to support the ACA

### Step 1: Find your Town Hall 

We've taken this week's upcoming town halls from [Town Hall Project](https://townhallproject.com/){:target="_blank"} and highlighted them according to what influential committee a Senator or Representative sits on. Check out our key tab in the link below to see which committees they are on!  These individuals will be crucial to forming the upcoming wave of health care policy.

### Step 2: Wow them with health care talking points

It can be hard to figure out what exactly to say to your member of congress about the ACA. Here are some ideas:

- Do you have a personal story to share? If so, share it. Personal stories demonstrate why repealing important tenets of the ACA will be detrimental to Americans.

- Tom Price, the new Health and Human Services secretary has introduced bills that would create insurance pools of high risk individuals. This means that people with preexisting conditions could face both higher premiums and deductibles.

- An ACA replacement would not require insurance companies to provide the comprehensive coverage that it does under the current law, reducing women's health care benefits and requiring more out-of-pocket payments. 

- The Republicans' proposal will likely reduce the subsidies currently in place for lower-income Americans. This would reduce poor Americans' access to health insurance and could lead to higher premiums for everyone. 

**Note:**  If you want to plan your involvement with others, find your local [Indivisible group](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/local-action-groups){:target="_blank"}. They may have a Facebook event and a game plan going for the next town hall near you.

<!-- Justification -->
##### Why does attending a town hall make sense?

{: class="post-justification"}
*Asking your representative to address your policy concerns in person is even more effective than calling your office. And if it makes the news, it brings public attention to your cause. The pressure, thus far, seems to be putting [lawmakers in a bind](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/13/politics/republican-lawmakers-town-hall-events/){:target="_blank"}.*

{: class="post-justification"}
*The town halls that we've chosen to highlight are hosted by congressmen that the MGMT have identified as ["Key Congressional Committees in Healthcare"](http://www.mgma.com/government-affairs/advocacy/advocacy-resources/key-congressional-committees-in-healthcare). The MGMT is a 90-old institution with a mission to advance medical practitioners through education and advocacy. Other sources corroborate the importance of these committees. An [article](http://www.medpagetoday.com/washington-watch/reform/62338) in the Washington Correspondant - MedPage reported that ACA "repeal and replace" procedurally starts with the House Budget Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. The House Ways and Means Committee will focus on the tax-related aspects of repeal, while the Energy and Commerce Committee will focus on Medicaid reform.*
