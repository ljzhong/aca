<!-- TITLE -->
# Save the ACA by Supporting Jon Ossoff for Georgia's 6th

<!-- Instructions -->
Each week this page will feature different candidates who could make a difference in protecting the Affordable Care Act.
Contribute to candidates in these races to win a seat for ACA supporters. 

#### Georgia's 6th District
Tom Price was appointed as Health and Human Services Secretary, vacating his seat in Georgia's 6th. 
John Lewis has endorsed [Jon Ossoff](https://electjon.com/ ){:target="_blank"} to replace Tom Price. The leading Democratic candidate, 
Jon will face off against both Republican and Democratic candidates in a special election, set for April 18.

<!-- Justification -->
##### Why does supporting these seats make sense?

{: class="post-justification"}
*There are currently 3 seats open in the House of Representatives that will be filled soon through special elections. Getting ACA allies elected will bring us closer to winning a majority of seats in the House and Senate. Having a majority will be essential to passing (or voting down) future healthcare legislation.*
