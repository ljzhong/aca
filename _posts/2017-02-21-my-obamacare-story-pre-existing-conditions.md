I'm one of those people who has many pre existing conditions. I use my state retirement insurance, Medicare and supplements. Though I don't use the ACA, the laws regarding insurance apply to me. I do pay a lot for my insurance, but if ACA is repealed my insurance premiums will go up more. I am a retired school teacher. I have a small retirement account and Social Security. I have heard diease, diabetes, scleroderma, fibromyalgia, Reynauds, and am waiting to see if I have leukemia. I'm 66, I cannot work and I barely afford my basic needs.
