#### Kansas' 4th District

Tom Price was appointed as Health and Human Services Secretary, vacating his seat in Georgia's 6th.

<!-- Justification -->
##### Why does supporting these seats make sense?

{: class="post-justification"}
*There are currently 3 seats open in the House of Representatives that will be filled soon through special elections. Getting ACA allies elected will bring us closer to winning a majority of seats in the House and Senate. Having a majority will be essential to passing (or voting down) future healthcare legislation.*
