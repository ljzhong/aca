<!-- TITLE -->
# Postcard Tsunami: Oppose Trumpcare

<!-- Instructions -->
If Trumpcare passes it will devastate the lives of millions of Americans. The time to contact your Representative is now. 

**And what better way to remind our representatives that we care than a pile of letters on their desk?**  
Send a personalized postcard to your Representative explaining why you oppose The Trumpcare/Ryancare plan. Then spread the word to help us hit our goal of **10,000 postcards!**
<!-- Button -->

<a class="post-link-btn btn red" href="http://fightforhealthcare.org/postcard-tsunami" > Create A Postcard</a>

### What Should I Write?  
- Share a personal story about how the ACA has helped you, and why it is important that any law maintains that kind of coverage
- Why Ryancare/Trumpcare would hurt you or people you know

<br/>
<!-- Justification -->

##### Why Send a Postcard?

{: class="post-justification"}
*The Republicans have introduced an ACA replacement that would be a detriment to many Americans. Contacting them through every channel is essential, and physical mail is an extremely effective way to do it. Every letter sent to Congress is scanned and noted. If our Representatives receive many letters about the repeal bill, they will have to pay attention.*
