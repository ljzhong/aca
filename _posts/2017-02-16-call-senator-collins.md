<!-- TITLE -->
# Call Susan Collins and Tell Her to Protect the ACA

<!-- Instructions -->
A number of Republican Senators have expressed concerns about repealing the Affordable Care Act without a susbsitute. If Congress commits to having a replacement in hand before repealing the ACA, citizens will have much more time to make their voices heard on future healthcare legislation. This week's focus is on Senator Susan Collins of Maine. 

### Instructions

<a name="script"></a>

#### Step 1 - If Susan Collins is your senator, call her!
Call your local offices or, if they are busy, Senator Collins' D.C. office

Susan Collins (ME)  
Augusta: [(207) 622-8414](tel:+12076228414)  
Bangor: [(207) 945-0417](tel:+12079450417)  
Biddeford: [(207) 283-1101](tel:+12072831101)     
Caribou: [(207) 493-7873](tel:+12074937873)  
Lewiston: [(207) 784-6969](tel:+12077846969)  
Portland: [(207) 780-3575](tel:+12077803575)  
Washington D.C.: [(202)224-2523](tel:+12022242523)  

{: style="text-align:center"}
<button id="script2" class="js-hide-show-button post-btn btn">
  What should I say?
  </button>

{: id="script2-section" class="hidden"}
> *Hi. I am a consituent from {x} city/zip code.*
>
> *I'm calling because I care passionately about the Affordable Care Act, and I want to urge Senator Collins to vote to support a program that saves millions of American lives. If there are flaws in the current system, Congress should work on fixing them, rather than deprive your constituents access to a program that can be the difference between life and heath.*
>
> *If I do not see Senator Collins vote against the repeal, they will not have my vote in the next election.*
>
> *Thank you.*

#### Step 2 - Find your friends in Maine

Check your address book for friends and family who are Mainers 

**Tip:** simply type in a search term like *"Friends in Maine"* into Facebook's search bar, and filter by *"People"*, like in the image below.

#### Step 3 - Ask them to call senator Collins.

Ask your friends to contact their senators to fix rather than repeal the ACA. We've provided a template for you to send your friends, if you want to shoot them a personal message. Or, you can share the post below on facebook and tag your friends in it.

  What should I say?
  </button>

{: id="script1-section" class="hidden"}
> *Hi, it's been a crazy few months for America. So much is changing around us that I can't believe we're still in the same country that we were three months ago. However, one thing I think it's important to not change is taking away healthcare access from millions of Americans. And that's what would happen if we revoked the ACA without a replacement plan in place.*
>
> *I'm contacting you because your senator (Senator Collins) has the same concerns that I do about repealing without replacement. I'm asking you to contact your senator to tell them that they have your support and attention, and that you, too, care about the future of American health. Basically, letting them know that you don't want to outright repeal the ACA.*

#### Step 3 - Now, do it again. 

Even getting one more friend to call their rep can tip the scales in our favor. You never know who the deciding call will be.

<!-- Justification -->
##### Why does calling Senator Collins make sense?

{: class="post-justification"}
Senator Collins (ME) co-wrote the Patient Freedom Act of 2017 and [introduced it to the Senate floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_anppscauh4) on January 17th, 2017. The bill essentially boils down to "If [a state] like[s] the Affordable Care Act, [is] can keep the Affordable Care Act." The F4H team believes having a policy like this in place would give states a protective buffer if the ACA were to be repealed at the federal level.  More details of the bill are explained in this [Portland Press Herald article](http://www.pressherald.com/2017/01/17/sens-collins-cassidy-to-offer-obamacare-replacement/).
