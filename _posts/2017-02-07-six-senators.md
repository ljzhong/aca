<!-- TITLE -->
# Call Your Senators Who Don't Want To Repeal Without a Replacement, and Recruit Your Friends, Too

<!-- Instructions -->
A number of Republican Senators have expressed concerns about repealing the Affordable Care Act without a susbsitute. If Congress commits to having a replacement in hand before repealing the ACA, citizens will have much more time to make their voices heard on future healthcare legislation.  

### Instructions

<a name="script"></a>

#### Step 1 - If any of these people are your Senators, call them

Tom Cotton (AR) [(202) 224-2353](tel:+12022242353)    
Susan Collins (ME) [(207) 622-8414](tel:+12076228414)  
Rand Paul (KY) [(202) 224-4343](tel:+12022244343)  
Bill Cassidy (LA) [(337) 493-5398](tel:+13374935398)  
Lamar Alexander (TN) [(202) 224-4944](tel:+12022244944)  
Bob Corker (TN) [(202) 224-3344](tel:+12022243344)  
Orrin Hatch (UT) [(202) 224-5251](tel:+12022245251)

<button id="script2" class="js-hide-show-button post-btn btn">
  What should I say?
  </button>

{: id="script2-section" class="hidden"}
> *Hi. I am a consituent from {x} city/zip code.*
>
> *I'm calling because I care passionately about the Affordable Care Act, and I want to urge Senator {y} to vote to support a program that saves millions of American lives. If there are flaws in the current system, Congress should work on fixing them, rather than deprive your constituents access to a program that can be the difference between life and heath.*
>
> *If I do not see Senator {y} vote against the repeal, they will not have my vote in the upcoming election.*
>
> *Thank you.*

#### Step 2 - Find your friends in these states

Check your address book for friends and family in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Tennessee, and Utah. 

**Tip:** simply type in a search term like *"Friends in Maine"* into Facebook's search bar, and filter by *"People"*, like in the image below.

#### Step 3 - Ask them to call their senators.

Ask your friends to contact their senators to fix rather than repeal the ACA. We've provided a template for you to send your friends, if you want to shoot them a personal message. Or, you can share the post below on facebook and tag your friends in it.

  What should I say?
  </button>

{: id="script1-section" class="hidden"}
> *Hi, it's been a crazy few months for America. So much is changing around us that I can't believe we're still in the same country that we were three months ago. However, one thing I think it's important to not change is taking away healthcare access from millions of Americans. And that's what would happen if we revoked the ACA without a replacement plan in place.*
>
> *I'm contacting you because your Senator has the same concerns that I do about repealing without replacement. I'm asking you to contact your senator to tell them that they have your support and attention, and that you, too, care about the future of American health. Basically, letting them know that you don't want to outright repeal the ACA.*

> *It's really easy to take action. Simple click the following link, and it will take you to easy-to-follow instructions on how to contact your rep and what to say: [https://www.fightforhealthcare.org/5friends/six-senators#script](https://www.fightforhealthcare.org/5friends/six-senators#script)*

#### Step 3 - Now, do it again. 

Even getting one more friend to call their rep can tip the scales in our favor. You never know who the deciding call will be.

#### Step 4 - You are done!
