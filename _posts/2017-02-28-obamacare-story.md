<!-- TITLE -->
# Tell Your Obamacare Story

<!-- Instructions -->
Fight For Healthcare is collecting personal stories about peoples' experiences with the ACA to display on our site and to spread awareness about the way lives have been impacted by the ACA. 

## Share your story

**UPDATE:** Fight for healthcare is in the middle of migrating to Uprise, a partner that can provide us the technical support needed to maintain our website and keep fighting for our rights.

*If you are interested in sharing your story, please PLEASE go to [Our Healthcare Cause on Uprise](https://goo.gl/7TmWMV), scroll down, and fill out your story there by clicking on "Tell your story". Thanks!*

Some examples of stories:

- What would happen to you if the ACA was repealed?
- What your health insurance coverage was like before versus after the ACA was passed?

##### Why we're asking for your story

{: class="post-justification"}
*Telling your personal story is one of the best ways to get your representatives to listen to you. When you submit your story, we will only use your zip code to identify where you are. Your identity will remain anonymous.*

{: class="post-justification"}
Why zip code? *So we can identify your representatives and advocate on your behalf. Knowing peoples' zip codes helps us better target representatives.*

{: class="post-justification"}
Why email? *When you enter your email address, we'll let you know when we've put your story up! We may also message you with other opportunities to fight for healthcare.*
