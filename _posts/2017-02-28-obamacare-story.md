##### Why we're asking for your story

{: class="post-justification"}
*Telling your personal story is one of the best ways to get your representatives to listen to you. When you submit your story, we will only use your zip code to identify where you are. Your identity will remain anonymous.*

{: class="post-justification"}
Why zip code? *So we can identify your representatives and advocate on your behalf. Knowing peoples' zip codes helps us better target representatives.*

{: class="post-justification"}
Why email? *When you enter your email address, we'll let you know when we've put your story up! We may also message you with other opportunities to fight for healthcare.*
