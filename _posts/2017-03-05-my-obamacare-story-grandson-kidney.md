Because of the ACA my 10 year old grandson who was born with only one working kidney has affordable healthcare insurance coverage without a lifetime cap and with no pre-existing condition restriction. Because his parents are both self-employed they could not obtain insurance coverages for their family that had reasonable deductibles, premums and co-pays. Over the years prior to the ACA they accrued over $85,000 in healthcare related debt for their son...a debt they will be paying off for the rest of their lives.
