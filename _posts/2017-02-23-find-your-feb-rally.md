#### Day-of-Rally Checklist:  

Here are some suggestions to prepare your for your rally so that you can spend the most amount of time there being as vocal and clear as possible.

- Bring a Cheer: Something short that people can rally around. E.g. "Hands off my healthcare"
- Make a Sign: Sometimes your voice wants a break. Creating a sign using *marker* and large letters helps you get your point across at every moment.
- Dress in layers if the event is outdoors, and don't forget water!
- Have a transportation plan. Rallies are traffic nightmares. Try to carpool with friends or split an Uber or Lyft
- On that note, bring a friend! You both will have a better time and stay longer.

Now forward the event [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yx1mXB_d1vg1E84TLZkZy7deSzyHt42E3tG2wZBNv3s/edit#gid=0) to your friends and family across the country so they can find ACA support events near them!

##### Why does attending a Rally make sense?

{: class="post-justification"} 
*Videos of angry constituents asking their representatives questions at town halls have recently gone viral. A nationwide outpouring of support for the ACA will demonstrate to lawmakers that their constituents are serious about having health care protections. Keeping the pressure on is the most important thing to do while we fight for fair and accessible health insurance.*
