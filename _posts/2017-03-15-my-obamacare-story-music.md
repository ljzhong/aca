I'm a recipient of Medicaid thanks to the ACA expansion, and because I have free, comprehensive health care, I have had the freedom of schedule and piece/peace of mind to tour the USA twice as a professional live guitarist for two artists on Barsuk Records and release a full length album of my own music. Thanks to the ACA I've been able to make and play music in Seattle, where I grew up, and be able to support myself as a private music teacher and part time Uber driver. Artists are a culture's most valuable asset because we define the culture; I wouldn't be able to afford to live here and create my art with more monthly bills; this city is too expensive for artists. Do not take away my Medicaid; if you do, me and hoards of other artists will unleash their cultural wrath on the government.
