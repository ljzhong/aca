<!-- TITLE -->
# Comment on HHS' Regulations for the ACA in 2018

<!-- Instructions -->
The Department of Health and Human Services has proposed new ACA regulations for 2018. They are soliciting public comments on their proposal. We only have until March 7th to comment, so there's no time to waste!  
**What's the point?** Good question.   
In short, it keeps the pressure on HHS and reminds them that Americans are watching
and want to participate. We are aware of their proposed regulations and we have opinions on them.  

{: style="text-align:center"}
If you have two minutes, it's worthwhile watching Andy Slavic, former head of the   
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, explain why your input is important.  
Watch from 23:10 to 24:53

**Ok, so you're ready to comment. What do you need to know?**
First of all, regulations.gov has some opinions about the way you comment. And those opinions are that they should be well informed. 
Second of all, these proposed changes are lengthy and kind of complicated. We are going to do our best to explain both the proposed 
regulations to you, and how you can most effectively respond to them. 

### Guide to Commenting

If you want to read all of the recommendations that regulations.gov has about commenting you can find the full list [here.](https://www.regulations.gov/docs/Tips_For_Submitting_Effective_Comments.pdf)
Otherwise, here's a summary:
- In your comments, respond specifically to the proposed rules. Refer to sections by their page and paragraph citation in the official document 
(good to do but not mandatory in our opinion)
- If you don't like the proposed solutions, lay out detailed counterpoints or propose another solution. 
- Use personal examples or rational arguments.   
Basically be academic and reasonable. Imagine that there is a rational, thoughtful person you are talking to who is going to take 
your opinions into consideration.      


### Now, What to Comment On

If you really want to know what you're talking about, [read this](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/15/14625014/obamacare-trump-regulation-marketplaces) 
very helpful *Vox* article, [or this](http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2017/02/16/unpacking-the-trump-administrations-market-stabilization-proposed-rule/) 
long, but illustrative *Health Affairs* article.  
Otherwise, here is our best summary of the changes:  

1. **A shortened open enrollment period.** Previously it was November 1 to January 31, but the Trump administration is now proposing 
shortening it to November 1 to December 15th. That cuts the open enrollment period in half, from 90 days to 45. This was originally 
proposed by the Obama administration to take place eventually, but the Trump administration would be bumping it up by a year. The 
reason: basically employers say that it allows them to stabilize their plans more quickly and know what they're dealing with.  But 
young people, who tend to do things at the last minute, might not sign up if the period is shorter.   

2. **Stricter requirements for a special enrollment period.** In addition to open enrollment, the ACA has special enrollment periods at 
other times of the year. These are for people who have experienced an important life change - having a baby or losing a job, for 
example - and need to sign up for coverage outside of the open enrollment period. Currently people can apply for special enrollment, 
and then submit proof that they qualify later. The new law would require them to submit proof prior to gaining coverage. As with the 
shortened period, this was going to be introduced by the Obama administration, but it was planned as a pilot for 2017. This policy would 
enact it for everyone.  

3. **A high likelihood of ACA premium subsidies going down.** If you want the quick and dirty explanation for something extremely complicated, 
(read the [Vox](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/15/14625014/obamacare-trump-regulation-marketplaces) article for further information) 
here goes. Basically a number of lower income Americans receive tax subsidies for their health insurance plans. These subsidies are based on 
a tiered system of health insurance plans. Insurance plans are evaluated on a scale from bronze to platinum (bronze being the lowest), 
based on how much of a person's health insurance costs they cover. Tax subsidies 
are calculated based on the second-cheapest silver plan (silver being the second lowest tier of coverage). Great. Important note, though, the 
Obama administration allowed a 2 percent margin of error on coverage. So insurance companies could offer 2% more or less coverage than 
required to be part of each class (70 percent for silver). The Trump administration is proposing increasing that to 4%. This means that 
the second cheapest silver plan (current benchmark), could drop to 66% of coverage, thus being a more expensive plan overall for Americans,
but with the same subsidy. The subsidy for low income Americans would then cover less of their total premiums for the year.   

4. **Denial of coverage based on debt.** Currently an insurance company can terminate coverage for someone who doesn't pay their premiums for 
three months, but cannot deny them coverage the following year if they sign up for a different plan. 
This change would allow insurers to include the debt as part of payment under a new plan or the denial of coverage completely to people 
seeking it from the same company.
