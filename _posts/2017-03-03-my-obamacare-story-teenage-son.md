In 2010, we found out very suddenly that our teenage son's kidney's were failing and that he would likely need dialysis or a transplant within a few years; he had never had any health problems before. Compounding this terrible news was the discovery that our healthcare policy (which I had taken out as a self-employed individual) did not cover ANY of the expensive medications or diagnostic tests that he suddenly needed. As a self-employed individual, I had taken out an affordable policy but one that in no way met the overwhelming and expensive medications our son,  Jack suddenly needed. With incredible help from Seattle Children’s Hospital we scraped by until we were able to get him on my husband's work policy during the next open enrollment period (the reason we didn’t have him on this policy before was that it cost $480/month to add one child to the policy).

When Jack reached Stage 5 kidney failure, he qualified for Medicare, which applies to all people of any age with kidney failure. Most people at this stage go on dialysis, but Jack was fortunate to receive the wonderful gift of a kidney from his uncle. By law, he qualified for Medicare for 2 more years following the transplant (of note, prior to the ACA, many transplant patients would do fine for 2 years but then no longer be able to afford their transplant meds and would subsequently lose their transplant and go back on dialysis and Medicare—a vicious and costly cycle, both in terms of human lives and our country’s resources).

When my husband lost his job (and Medicare was no longer covering Jack), I covered our family through the ACA. It was such a simple process, and we had access to the quality care Jack needs. Because of our income, we did not receive insurance subsidies. The cost for us was pretty steep, but the devastating alternative of not being able to insure Jack was so much worse. Please just try to imagine how families could ever cope with annual, ongoing medical bills of $50,000 and more.

I now cover my family through a work policy but am devastated about what is happening to the ACA. The ACA provides incredible peace of mind that care will ALWAYS be accessible to EVERYONE.

Here is a summary of how the Affordable Care Act (ACA) helps kidney transplant patients:

1. Individuals cannot be turned away from insurance due to a pre-existing condition.
2. All insurance plans must include a basic level of coverage, which includes expensive immunosuppressive prescription medications that kidney transplant recipients must take every day of their life. If they do not take these medications, they will lose their transplant.
3. The ACA lifted the lifetime cap on benefits. It’s very easy for people with chronic conditions to reach a lifetime limit of $1 million.
4. An added benefit for Jack is that he can be on my insurance until he is 26 (he is now 20).

(I’m sure there are other ways that the ACA helps, but these are the major points I’m aware of).
